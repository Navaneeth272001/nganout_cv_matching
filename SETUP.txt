# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

## Files Created

You now have these 5 files ready to download:

1. **`.env`** - Configuration file (API keys go here)
2. **`server.js`** - Express backend that calls the LLM
3. **`app.js`** - Frontend JavaScript
4. **`package.json`** - Node.js dependencies
5. **`README.md`** - Complete documentation

Plus your existing:
- `index.html` - Frontend UI (keep as is)
- `style.css` - Styling (keep as is)

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Download All Files

Download the 5 new files and place them in a folder with your existing `index.html` and `style.css`.

Your folder should look like:
```
my-resume-matcher/
├── .env
├── server.js
├── app.js
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── index.html
└── style.css
```

### Step 2: Get an API Key (Choose One)

**Option A: OpenAI (Easiest)**
- Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Sign up (free $5 credit)
- Create a new API key
- Copy the key

**Option B: Perplexity (Free)**
- Go to: https://www.perplexity.ai/api
- Sign up
- Get your API key

**Option C: DeepSeek (Cheap)**
- Go to: https://platform.deepseek.com/api
- Sign up (free $5 credit)
- Get your API key

**Option D: Local Ollama (Free, Offline)**
- Download from: https://ollama.ai
- Install and run
- Pull a model: `ollama pull llama2`
- No API key needed

### Step 3: Edit `.env` File

Open `.env` and replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key:

```env
# For OpenAI:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
PORT=3000

# For Perplexity (change these instead):
# OPENAI_API_KEY=pplx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.perplexity.ai
# OPENAI_MODEL=llama-2-70b-chat

# For DeepSeek (change these instead):
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
# OPENAI_MODEL=deepseek-chat

# For Local Ollama (change these instead):
# OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
# OPENAI_MODEL=llama2
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

Open terminal/command prompt in your folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs: express, cors, dotenv

### Step 5: Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
✓ Using model: gpt-4o-mini
✓ Using endpoint: https://api.openai.com/v1

✅ Server running at http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 6: Open in Browser

Go to: `http://localhost:3000`

Now you can:
1. Upload resume PDFs
2. Upload job description PDFs
3. Click "Process with AI"
4. See LLM-powered match scores
5. Export results as CSV or Excel

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "npm: command not found"
- Node.js is not installed
- Download from: https://nodejs.org (use LTS version)
- Restart terminal after installing

### "OPENAI_API_KEY is not set"
- Check `.env` file exists in your folder
- Make sure you edited it with your real API key
- Don't use `your_api_key_here` - replace it!

### "Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3000"
- Another app is using port 3000
- Either close that app or change PORT in `.env` to 3001, 3002, etc.

### "LLM request failed: 401"
- Your API key is wrong or expired
- Get a new one from your provider's dashboard

### "LLM request failed: 429"
- Rate limit hit (too many requests)
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Or upgrade your API plan

---

## Switching LLM Providers Later

Just edit `.env` and change:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (your key from new provider)
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (endpoint URL)
- `OPENAI_MODEL` (model name)

Restart server: `npm start`

No code changes needed!
